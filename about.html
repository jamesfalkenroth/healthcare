                <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
                <p>
                    Inadequate health insurance coverage remains one of the largest barriers to healthcare in the United States. According to data from the 2020 National Health Interview Survey, in 2020, 31.6 million (9.7%) of people in the United States of America were uninsured. Most uninsured people in the U.S. come from low-income families, and racial minority groups make up over half of the uninsured population. This lack of insurance causes major disparities in health, as uninsured individuals are far more likely to dismiss needed care.

                    Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) are a significant resource for these populations as they utilize a sliding fee scale, making their services accessible for all regardless of their ability to pay. Although approximately 1400 centers are currently funded, only about 1 in 3 people living in poverty and 1 in 5 rural residents receive care from these centers. In Los Angeles—with an over 16% impoverished population—FQHCs should be particularly helpful. We would like to examine the efficacy of FQHCs in LA and for UCLA students  specifically, who may be facing additional financial burdens such as student loans.

                <h1>OUR OBJECTIVE</h1>
                <p>
                    In the diverse UCLA student body, 34% of undergraduates receive Pell Grants for exceptional financial need, showing a relevance of FQHCs to the UCLA student population. For our project, we aim to use UCLA student data to visualize awareness and utilization of FQHCs among young adults from underprivileged communities, which will help determine the impacts of these centers on their target communities. As shown by the background statistics, only about 33% of people living in poverty and 20% of rural residents receive care from FQHCs. With this knowledge, we would like to shed light on the experiences and reasons why FQHCs are so underutilized within the diverse UCLA student population. We will create a map showing rates of FQHC utilization among qualifying members within their area codes. We will also create a platform through which students can share their experiences with FQHCs and any barriers that have kept them from effectively accessing the centers’ resources.

                <h1>LONG-TERM IMPACT</h1>
                <p>
                    By giving young underserved community members a space to share their stories and learn about FQHCs in their area, we can help increase both awareness and use of healthcare centers by their target population. Additionally, our data on a more aggregated scale can give insight on where FQHCs are being used and where they are being underutilized in order to better understand the specific communities that would best be served by any additional resources or changes in FQHCs designed to make them more effective in achieving their mission. Given the range of service organizations at UCLA, we could potentially partner with student organizations on campus, providing data to build and distribute targeted resources based on student needs.
