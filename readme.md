We plan to use our mapplication to help provide locations and information on federally qualified healthcare centers in local areas. Our mapplication will empower people who are unable to pay for medical services due to lack of funds and/or lack of health insurance coverage by addressing the social problem of the lack of affordable healthcare options, especially for people in low-income communities. In making our mapplication, we need to consider accessibility (based on language and technology) of our application and may need to perform further research on the true effectiveness of federally qualified healthcare centers for low income populations.
